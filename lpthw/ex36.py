Designing and Debugging Tips


    For If-Statements

        1. Every If must have an Else.

        2. Never nest if-statements more than two deep. If there is a need to do so, a new function can handle the task.

        3. Treat If-Statements like Paragraphs. With an extra line spacing between.

        4. Keep boolean tests simple. If they are complex, break them into pre-defined variables.

    For While-Loops

        1. Only necessary when you want the nested activity to run forever.

        2. Use a for loop, for other kinds of looping.
